Odile wondered how they could kill the time. Franz had read about an American who had done the Louvre in nine minutes, and forty-five seconds. They'd do better. Arthur, Franz, and Odile beat the record by Jimmy Johnson of San Francisco by two seconds." - Bande à part, 1964 [1]

### Motivation
- While we were walking around Cloisters, I wondered if there's a way to keep track of which galleries you've visited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the fourth largest museum in the world [2].
- Although there's something inherently romantic about a dérive / getting lost in a museum, this app is to help museum lovers comb the collections so as not to miss any gems.

### Research
- MET api
- Google maps shows the gallery #
- How to display these data
- Heatmap? Which pieces did we enjoy the most
- Realtime altitude / floor
- Realtime path of pieces you've encountered
- Scaling for Louvre, et al
- Does the user need to keep the app open? Or? **What? Exactly? Is? Going? On? Here?**
